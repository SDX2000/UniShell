===========
- redirection
- external commands, set search paths
- conditionals if/else/elif, pattern matching with match
- loops
- lists, a = [a b c], a.len(), a[0], a[1:]

 
======
 TODO
======
 - Be case insensitive
 - Improve syntax error messages. Do not say "SYNTAX ERROR:  Expected 'WS' at position..." instead skip all non essential tokens and report the next required rule match (list all rules if there are multiple choices)
 - Test on cygwin/mintty in addition to cmd.exe on windows

Implement console features:-
 - Autocomplete
 - History
 - Find/implement pure python implementation of readline and ncurses for windows.
 
Implement language features:-
 
 - Add hex and octal integer literals. Use separate float and integer literals
 - user defined prompts
 - strings, quoted strings, escapes, slicing, string operations
 - string interpolation "$x, ${x}H, $(time)". The $ sign is only required within strings for interpolation.
 - dictionaries d = {x:1 y:2}; d = (dict [a b c d])
 - regular expression literals /abc/ig, =~
 - numbers, (num x), (str n)
 - wildcards *,**,?
 - functions
 - variables, scopes, persistence (use json/sqlite?), x = 10, print x
 - command substitution (pwd)
 - exceptions (try, catch, finally)
 - pipes
 
 
Implement commands :-
 - ls
 - copy
 - rsync
 - exec $code
 - alias
 - echo
 - funcsave, funced, vared
 - basename
 - dirname
 - pushd, popd, nextd, prevd
 - choose_prompt, set_prompt, save_prompt_as (use ncurses for UI if required)
 - map, filter, reduce, zip etc. Look at the python pipes library, itertools module and Haskell Lists module for inspiration
 
Automatic variables :-
 - SCRIPT_DIR
 
======
 DONE
======
- Context.isExported(varName)
- Context.getVar() should return the value of the variable instead of the Variable class
- Let command be an expr
- Remove CmdResult class. Use generic python objects instead (like string and numbers) or create custom pipeline objects to represent command specific information
   - use __str__ to convert objects into terminal output for the time being
- literals should return their value when used as a command

 REJECTED

 X Reset interpreter between scripts. REASON: This is not required a separate instance of the interpreter should be launched and the script should be run inside it if a new environment is required. Running multiple scripts in the same env can be useful. REVISIT LATER: Maybe
